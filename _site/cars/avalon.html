The Bruh is what replaced my first car, which was a 1997 Avalon I gave away. I got this car in November 2018, 
after realizing I probably still needed a car while I was in college. I was looking on facebook for just about any 4-door when this 
one showed up for 800$. It ended up getting the 'Bruh' name because of how rock solid of a rig for under a grand this was. It left a 
smokescreen down SR-7, when I got it. Apparently, someone said it caught fire, but made it back in one piece. Granted, 
it's gotten at least $2000 worth of parts in it, but it's always been for things that I could've ignored
taking care of. All quality of life things, mostly. 

I did fix the smoking: rear valve cover gasket + some ace hardware steel washers. Real shit, if you find a smoking avalon, 
just shim the valve cover bolts with washers and tighten it down. Toyota used some torque-to-yield 
bolts on the covers, and heat cycling stretches them and they won't hold the covers down tight anymore.

Maintenence log at the end...

The 1MZ-FE non-VVTI motors are standard on the Avalons, so you can eliminate a ton of guesswork when comparing these to the 
same model-year Camrys and avoid the awkward questions to the guy when you go to buy one. 
The Aisin A541 autos are really good for a 4-speed, especially for 1996, and can take a pretty rough handling and still come 
out the other side working. Scotty has put out multiple videos saying these trannys are unreliable pieces of junk, but you can 
take a look at Neutral Drops video on the same gen ES300, and that thing took 20 good D-R-D drops before giving up. Change the fluid like
ever, and you're chillin. Any Dex-II/III full synth ATF will work. I use the valvoline stuff, plus a quart of loves.

Maintenence on the A541 is kinda goofy because the transaxle is split into 2 fluid wells internally, so filling the trans + diff
is thru 2 separate fill bolts. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORGET to fill both after a filter or fluid change.

Gas mileage is ~20, +/- 5 if you're doing all highway or in-town. Super smooth and uneventful driving, especially after doing all 
the motor mounts. Definitely do the back lower one, they tend to sag down and tip the whole motor back, which is what kills those 
top dogbone torque mounts. It moves, but isn't zippy. It's a good amount of go, and doesn't feel like Toyota's shit new autos. Pulls
on the highway from 60-85 when you need to pass someone are GOOD. This thing was meant for looong highway trips.

Tangent, those 0W-20, turbo 4's in the 2020+ RAV4, Crowns, Camrys suuuuuck. I swear, I put my foot the floor in one of those, 
the trans had an existential crisis and watched all the Godfather movies before changing gears. If thats the new standard, 
this things like an 8HP by comparrison.

Spark plugs are these weird dual-electrode types because the ignition is waste-spark. Actually smart, because getting in for coil 
replacements is 3 10-mils right on top. Toyota switched to 6-coil for VVT-I 1MZs, but idk. I guess the plugs last longer...

The 1MZ is non-interference, so a timing belt snap isn't the end of the world. The problem really stems from people not replacing the 
water pumps on belt swaps. It's in there, you can get the Aisin OEM kit, just swap it with the belt and never worry about overheating ever.
Plus, the pump bearing is an idler in the timing system, so you really don't want one failing on you, even if nothing breaks.

The bruh get a lot of my projects hooked onto it, the big one right now is the conveniently named "Bruh Button." No affiliation to the 
Bruh car. The factory speakers are the worst in any car ever. I put desktop speaker drivers in some 3D printed boxes from the side mirror 
mounts on the doors, and that made a huge difference. Not amazing, but won't make your ears sore after 30 minutes.

No check engine light, new plugs in March, its almost due for another timing belt, since I did it @ 210k in 2018.
