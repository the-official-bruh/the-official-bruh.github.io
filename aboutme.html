<h1>Who's this guy?</h1>

<p>
Shane Aspenwall here. I've been told I'm a bit off the end sometimes. I can't find any evidence to disprove that.

<p>I've got goals, interests, opinions. I try to keep to myself. Sometimes I
   like to express myself. Some days I really just want people to fuck off.

<p>Day by day, different things will grab my attention and I'll end up spending way too much
time learning how to do it. When it comes to electrical stuff, I am always trying to learn
something new.
